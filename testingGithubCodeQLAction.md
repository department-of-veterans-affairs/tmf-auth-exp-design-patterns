# Here we have some simple markdown

I will remove this file later and probably will just delete this branch once I verify that CodeQL is running on all commits / PRs depending on how we want it set up.

## Other things to consider

- would we commit actual code here. I think it's valuable to run CodeQL for security even on just Markdown/docs repos, but should we actually build things in this repo?
  - if we did want to build in this repo, then what would the file structure look like?
